# Project Summary - Nathan Anderson

## Larger Disc Chipper Frame Analysis

A large mobile whole tree chipper frame was analyzed to determine peak stresses and deflections in the frame.  A peak stress aligned with an area of cracking and a new design was proposed to reduce the stress in the critical area around the chipper disc to improve the service life of the chipper housing.

## Random Vibration Analysis of Trailer Housing Sensitive Electronics

In this analysis a trailer containing sensitive electroncis was analysed for random vibration from road noise.  The analysis was performed and results post processed to determine the stress and deflection of the interior structure of the trailer.

## External Flow of Small Electric Vehicle

A CFD study was performed to determine the drag coefficient of a small three wheeled electric vehicle.  After initial results of the study correlated with test results to show a high drag coefficient, design improvements were suggested and analysed to reduce the drag to an acceptable limit.

## Aerospace Machining Center Bed Analysis

A large aerospace machining center was analysed and deflection results were reported to determine if the machining loads would cause error in the machining process.  The first design exceed the allowable tolerances and with after providing guidance on design updates the deflection of the machine bed was brought within specification.

## Medical Device Warehous HVAC System Anaylsis

A CFD study was performed to verify that the medical devices stored in a large warehouse would be maintained with a specified temperature range.  Several scenarios were run to determine the HVAC system performace under cooling and heating modes during the high temperatures of summer and cold days of winter.  

## ASME Section VIII, Div.  2 Pressure Vessel Transportation Analysis

The PV in this analysis was a large shell-and-tube heat exchanger analyzed under transportation conditions.  The project required the design of the shipping support structures: a schnabel at the skirt and a saddle at the upper tubesheet.  Once the static stress analysis was performed, the results were interrogated to ensure that the stresses within the PV did not exceed the ASME allowables (PL,PM for membrane stress and PL+PB+Q for surface stress) and the stresses within the support structures did not exceed AISC N690 stress allowables.  

## ASME Section VIII, Div.  2 Pressure Vessel Lifting Analysis

In this analysis the PV was analyzed for lifting loads at various angles as the vessel is installed.  The main concern was the skirt, tailing lug and trunnions.  The mass of the vessel was a critical parameter.  To ensure proper mass was include the finite element model used beam elements to approximate the tube sheet; this greatly improved the efficiency of the model.  Initially, the tailing lug was not adequate but after a couple design suggestions a final design was found.

## Wind Turbine Tower Analyses

A vibration study of 3 small wind turbine towers was conducted to determine the natural frequency of the towers.  It was important to ensure that the rotating blades would not excite the normal modes of the structures.  Once the normal modes of the towers were calculated, an excitation load was applied with at sine-sweep at the top of the towers.  The goal was to idealize any rotor imbalance loads and apply them to the tower throughout the operating rotational-speed range of the turbine.

In addition to the analysis of the erect towers, it was important to analyze the bottom-out event the towers experience as the hinged structure is lowered to the ground.  Using the FE model to determine the stiffness of the towers in the lowered position, it was possible to calculate the deceleration of the towers as they experience the bottom-out event.  Thisload was applied to the FE models with a body-acceleration.

## Wind Turbine Assembly Analyses

A small wind turbine rotor was analyzed to verify its compliance with the International Electrotechnical Commission wind turbine generator systems (IEC 61400-1) publication.  The project started with a review of IEC 61400-1 and verification of the load calculations performed by the client.  Once the loads were verified, the blade flange, shaft, nacelle and alternatorhousing were analyzed for worst case wind conditions.  Several design iterations where evaluated which yielded a final passing design.
